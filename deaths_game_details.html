                Death's Game centers on Choi Yee-jae, a young man who attempts suicide after struggling to find a job
                for
                seven years. Death, however, is offended by Yee-jae's lack of concern for dying and chooses to punish
                him by
                making him play a game in which he must reincarnate and die 12 times before being sent to hell. But
                Yee-jae
                discovers that if he survives in any of the 12 incarnations, he will be able to continue living. Even
                after
                taking his own life, he begins to question whether things would have gone differently if he had lived
                the
                lives of others.
